## About repositories
Currently, I'm renaming repository, and add prefixes to them.<br>
L stands for Learning, where I developed the code without AI copy-paste codes.<br>
VC stands for Vibe Coding with AI copy-paste codes.<br>
L-VC is combination of L and VC, with various proportions. Just assume L-VC as VC, I just need to differentiate both.<br>
NOTE: not a regular renaming, still need time to classify former repositories from past college days.<br>
Currently, I'm a college student.<br><br>
